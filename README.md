            <h1> 1.Mpule Kwelagobe,Miss Universe 1999.</h1>

            <p> In 1999, a new dawn was set on the scene of African pageantry when a 19 year old from Botswana brought the first Miss Universe title to Africa.She became the first black African woman to clinch the coveted title and the 48th Miss Universe since the pageant was formed in 1952.Mpule beat 84 other contestants in a tough competition that was hosted in Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
            
            <h1> 2.Agbani Daregbo,Miss World 2001.</h1>
            <br><img src = "agbani daregbo.jpeg">
            <p> Just 2 years after Mpule created a name for Africa on the Miss Universe platform,Agbani Darego did justice to the continent by becoming the first black African to win Miss World. The Nigerian model beat other contestants to create such a historic mark in the history of the continent.</p>
            
            <h1> 3.Winfred Adah Omwakwe,Miss Earth 2002.</h1>
            <br><img src ="Wilfred_n.jpg" >
            <p> Africa couldn't wait for long before it proved its internationally undermined significance as Kenya went on to clinch one of the most prestigious titles in the world of pageantry, Miss Earth 2002. Adah became the first black and African woman to hold the title.</p>
            
            <h1> 4.Zozibini Tunzi, Miss Universe 2019.</h1>
            <img src ="Zozibini.jpg">
            <p> It would not be fair to talk about Africa's pageant legends without mentioning Zozi. Whilst the previous represented the African continent well, Zozibini proved to the world that beauty isn't a standard but rather it is more of originality. Her story exudes the truest Africanicity as she became the first Miss Universe with Afro Textured hair.</p>
